        ## 0 - Preparation
        ### 0.1 Set up deep learning environment.
        
        - [Setup Python Environment](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/dldp/requirements.txt)
          
        - [Package Installation for Color Normalization](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/dldp/dldp/utils/Color_Normalization.md) 
        
        	Note: SPAMS doesn't need to be installed mannually from source anymore since it can be installed through pip.
                
        - Tensorflow and Keras version
        
        	The code here was based on Keras 2.0.0 and Tensorflow 1.9. The compatibility between Tensorflow and Keras, and between Tensorflow and CUDA, are important, especially when the code runs on different machines. Certain machinse can only run some low version of Tensorflow that is compatible with a low version of Keras. When loading a model trained with higher version of Tensorflow and Keras to such a machine, the weights of the trained model would not be fully loaded, but it still works for testing (however, not for training, e.g., transfer learning). The code would need some changes if Keras with a version higher than 2.0.0 is used for model training (see the comments in the code for model training). 
          
        
        ### 0.2 ASAP installation and image display
        
        #### OpenSlide
        
        - [OpenSlide Installation](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/dldp/dldp/utils/OpenSlide_Installation.md)
        
        - OpenSlide can serve as a backend for a web viewer of WSI.

        ![alt text](https://github.com/3dimaging/Accessory/blob/master/webserver-enlarged.png)
        
        #### ASAP
        
        - [ASAP Installation](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/dldp/dldp/utils/ASAP_installation.txt)
           
        ### 0.3 Mask image generation
        
        - Mask images can be generated from the xml files that store the pathologist's annotation of tumor contours and serve as ground truth for model training. The mask image is a binary image with normal tissue coded as ‘0’ and tumor tissue coded as ‘1’ for each corresponding pixel of a WSI image. To directly display the masks, the code here use 255 (rather than 1) for tumor pixels. See update for mask file generation on [Camelyon 17 website](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/).
        - **Note**:
        	- The mask file has a pyramid structure corresponding to multiple levels of magnification. Except for the 40x 		magnification at which the xml annotation was made, the mask size may be slightly different from the corresponding 	   WSI because the method used for creating the pyramid structure in the mask file may be different from that used for 		WSI.
        
        	- The code below for the CAMELYON16 training slides is based on ASAP code, but we found that it did not work for testing slides. We therefore wrote our own mask generation code for the testing slides.

        ### 2.1 Image Segmentation 
        
        To reduce computation, the blank regions (no tissue) on slide will be excluded.
        
        - Color space switch to HSV
        
        - Tissue region segmentation (Otsu’s method of foreground segmentation)

        - Note: The codes for the following procedures are part of the modules for CNN training. 
        
        #### Step 0 : tumor training images and normal training images were randomly divided into training and validation data set.
        
        	          80% for training data set;
        		  20% for validation data set. 
        		  images for validation data set: 
        		  tumor: tumor_002.tif, tumor_008.tif, tumor_010.tif, tumor_019.tif, tumor_022.tif, tumor_024.tif, tumor_025.tif, 
        		         tumor_031.tif, tumor_040.tif, tumor_045.tif, tumor_049.tif, tumor_069.tif, tumor_076.tif, tumor_083.tif,
        			 tumor_084.tif, tumor_085.tif, tumor_088.tif, tumor_091.tif, tumor_101.tif, tumor_102.tif, tumor_108.tif, 
        			 tumor_109.tif
        			 
        		  normal: normal_003.tif, normal_013.tif, normal_021.tif, normal_023.tif, normal_024.tif, normal_030.tif, normal_031.tif
        		  	  normal_040.tif, normal_045.tif, normal_057.tif, normal_062.tif, normal_066.tif, normal_068.tif,normal_075.tif,
        			  normal_076.tif, normal_080.tif, normal_087.tif, normal_099.tif, normal_100.tif, normal_102.tif, normal_106.tif
        			  normal_112.tif, normal_117.tif, normal_127.tif, normal_132.tif, normal_139.tif, normal_141.tif, normal_149.tif
        			  normal_150.tif, normal_151.tif, normal_152.tif, normal_156.tif
        
        #### Step 1 : Randomly extract patches (256 x 256) on the tissue region at the level of 40x
                       
        		Tumor slide : 1K positive and 1K negative from each slide. So total patches for tumor tissue: 111k
        
        		Normal slide: 1K negative from each slide. So total patches for normal tissue: 111k + 159k = 270k
                    
        
        #### Step 2 : Crop 224x224 patches and conduct image augmentation
        
        - Method I: [flip, rotation and cropping](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/dldp/dldp/image_process/patch_aug.py)
        
        	 	For a 256x256 image patch from step 1, it was flipped,rotated 3 times. The original 256x256 image patch became 4 image patches. Then based on the 4 256x256 image patches, 2 224x224 image patches were randomly cropped from them. So I had total 8 224x224 image patches derived from 1 256x256 image patch. However, for normal image patches, only 1 224x224 image patches were randomly cropped from them.
        		
        		So, I have total image patches for tumor tissue: 111 x 8 = 888k, for normal tissue: 270 x 4 = 1080k
        		
        		
        ![Crop and Flip](https://github.com/3dimaging/Accessory/blob/master/crop%20and%20flip.png "crop and flip")
        
        - Method II: stain (color) normalization and adding color noise
        
        	      For method II, I will have 2 millions of 224x224 image patches for training model. Because, all the previous 224x224 image patches will be color-normalized, then be added color noise. The orginal image patch with color-normalization, plus the one with color noise will give me two 224 x 224 images from 1 224 x 224 images. So I will have total 888 x 2 = 1776k for tumor; 1080 x 2 = 2160k for normal tissue.

         If the image patches were added by a big value that will cause the some pixel values larger than 255, the image patches after adding color noise will look like this (not preferred):

        ### GoogleNet (Inception V1) Training
        
        #### Step 1: Network Training
        
        [Training GoogleNet](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/dldp/dldp/cnn_train/main.py)
        
        - Optimization method: Stochastic gradient descent
        
        - Weight initialization: Random sampling from a Gaussian distribution
        
        - Batch size: 32
        
        - Batch normalization: No
        
        - Regularization: L2-regularization (0.0005) and 50% dropout
        
        - Learning rate: 0.01, multiplied by 0.5 every 50,000 iterations (0.01, multiplied by 0.1 per epoch)
        
        - Activation function: ReLu
        
        - Loss function: Cross-entropy
        
        - Number of training epochs/iterations: 300,000 iterations
        
        #### Step 2: Hard Negative Mining
        
            Details (11-06-18): 120k 224x224 image patches were extracted based on the predicted; then augmentation were performed by using rotation and horizontal flip. For example, 1 224x224 image patch was rotated 3 times, and get 4 image patches. Then the 4 image patches were flipped horizontal and get total 8 different patches. So, total about 1 million of patches were used for hard negative mining. 
            To get a model with hard negative mining, googlenet v1 was retrained by adding the above mentioned 1 million of patches to my original training patches (1 million of normal 224 patches and 1 million of tumor 224 patches).

        1. The ratio between the area of metastatic regions and the tissue area.
        2. The sum of all cancer metastases probailities detected in the metastasis identification task, divided by the tissue area. 
        caculate them at 5 different thresholds (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), so the total 10 global features
        
        ##### Local Features Extraction 
        
        Based on 2 largest metastatic candidate regions (select them based on a threshold of 0.5).
        
        10 features were extracted from the 2 largest regions:
        
        1. Area: the area of connected region
        2. Eccentricity: The eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same second-moments as the region
        3. Extend: The ratio of region area over the total bounding box area
        4. Bounding box area
        5. Major axis length: the length of the major axis of the ellipse that has the same normalized second central moments as the region
        6. Max/mean/min intensity: The max/mean/minimum probability value in the region
        7. Aspect ratio of the bounding box
        8. Solidity: Ratio of region area over the surrounding convex area

        ### 4.2b Lesion-based Detection
        
        - Combine the prediction results from Model-1 and Model-2
        
        Model-1 is the model from step 2 (with hard negative mining) in section 3 - "Training Neural Netowrk";
        
        Model-2 is the model from step 3 (with hard negative mining patches and normal patches near tumor regions) in section 3 - "Training Neural Netowrk".
        
        The x, y coordinates of predicted tumor lesion come from Model-1; The scores of predicted tumor lesion are the average of scores from Model-1 and Model-2.
